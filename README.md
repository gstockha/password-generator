NOTES
Definitely a few lines longer than it needed to be; wanted to give the user more feedback with their initial options (ie chosing to include numbers or not). Also, could've dillineated some sub functions for the generator function.
Also also, temporary arrays are not the best in terms of memory, so I'm curious what the absolute best method for this as surely it's not simply iterating through the character list (rChars in the code) and running them against parameter checks...
Pretty straightforward assignment!
